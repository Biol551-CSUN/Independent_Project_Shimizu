# Independent_Project_Shimizu

### Background Information 
A lot of people know about what pain is but not so much about people know about what nociceptor is? Well its actually the pain after the pain.

Many research has been done on mammals, especially mice and rats, but not so much has been done on sharks. One way to do that is observing the area of neurons in the sensory neuron. Especially in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and trigeminal ganglion (TG). 

We are testing if the sharks actually do not feel any nociception or not. In the chart provided below I have data on DRG and TG's of sting rays (_Urobatis_ _hallari_), pre-hatched and adult.

### Data Used 
drg_tg_data <- read_csv(here("Independent_project_sharks","data","20220524_masterlist.csv")) 

data_dictionary <-read_csv (here("Independent_project_sharks","data","shark_dat_dictionary.csv")) 

### Contents

The Sting Rays sensory nearon's, mostly dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal genglia (TG)'s, width (x), length (y), area, perimeter, and the tissue where the neuron was located.
